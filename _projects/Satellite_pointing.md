The system under study is a satellite located in a geostationary orbit pointing at a static location on the Earth surface. It was selected as it is a common interest to all of our group members to understand better how pointing or attitude control in a satellite operates. Those systems can have a lot of applications, from commercial purposes to research and defense, and even if we don’t actively work with such systems in the future, we still use them directly or indirectly in our daily lives. They are used for radio and television communications but can also now be used for messaging on our phones and other fun things.
