For the design phase of the torque-wrench project, I created an updated instrumented wrench that satisfied both sensitivity and structural requirements using analytical calculations and finite-element modeling. The original steel design produced strain levels too low for reliable measurement, so I redesigned the wrench using Tool Steel AISI W2 to improve strength-to-weight performance and allow higher measurable strain without compromising safety. I validated the new rectangular beam geometry using classical beam theory and ANSYS simulations, confirming that maximum stress, crack-growth resistance, and fatigue life all exceeded the assignment’s required safety factors. To meet the target electrical output, I implemented a full-bridge strain-gauge configuration, which doubled the mV/V sensitivity relative to the baseline and produced a predicted 1.8 mV/V signal under load. This workflow combining material selection, structural optimization, and instrumentation—demonstrates my ability to integrate mechanical analysis with practical sensing considerations to engineer a functional measurement tool.
